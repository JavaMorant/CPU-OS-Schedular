- Create own scenario files
- Start report
- Check if schedular works as intended
- The analysis should always be in service of answering relevant questions about scheduler behaviour,
for example: are there cases where your algorithm starves some tasks of CPU time? How does it
balance interactive and batch tasks? What are the pathological scenarios? Marks for this part are
awarded for non-trivial, well-evidenced analysis in service of relevant and informative conclusions.
The code quality of analysis scripts is not being assessed.
